ResponsiveCollectionViewLayout
==============================

A collection view layout allowing full customization of cell frames from the delegate as well as long-press reordering.

Most of the code has been translated directly from [LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout](https://github.com/lxcid/LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout) into Swift. I have no short term plans to document this repo. Please take a look at [LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout](https://github.com/lxcid/LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout) if you are looking for a superclass of UICollectionViewFlowLayout that supports reordering cells with drag gestures.
